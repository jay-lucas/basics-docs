What is Blazor?
- Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed
  of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is
  written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Basics of Blazor
- Blazor is a hybrid of two workds: Razor and Browser
- Blazor is a templating engine to build dynamic content that's combining C# and Html
- Blazor is a framework for building interactive client-side web user interfaces with .NET. 
- Blazor shares server and client-side app logic written in C# .NET and applications are rendered 
  in mainstream browsers without having to know JavaScript
- Make use of the components built with razor to render dynamic thats used to develop single page 
  applications (SPA)
- Uses C# instead of JavaScript to create rich interactive web applications

Why Use Blazor?
- Blazor is a good replacement for SPA's frameworks like React, Angular.
- If C# is your prefered language and you don't want to use all endless JavaScript frameworks (jQuery, React, etc)
- Leverage all advantages of .NET and the .NET ecosystem (Security, Performance, Reliablity, etc)

How to build a Blazor App?
- Blazor apps are based on reuseable components
  * Components is a basic UI element like a page, dialog, or form written in form of a Razor page with the .razor file extension
  * When creating a new component you get the boiler plate code with a <h3> tag and the @code {} block to start
  * A Razor page and a Razor Component are two different files that both use the Razor syntax. Razor components have the extention .razor while Razor pages have
    the extention .cshtml

- Blazor component syntax 
  * The Razor html code
    <div> Count: @currentCount </div>
  * The C# code 
    @code {
      private int currentCount = 5;
    }
  * The routing to a Blazor page
    @page "/mypage"

- Blazor component are inbuilt and self contained
  - Common Components:
    * Form Components: InputSelect, InputNumber
    * NavLink
    * NavMenu
    * PageTitle

  *Note adding @page "/index" to a component page, in this example Index, is rooting the component, meaning it can be accesses through the URL. 
   Without this, this is a non rootable component. This component can now be used like a HTML <NonRootableComonentName /> throughout the system. 

  Different Blazor Templates
  - WebAssembly 
  - Server
    
Blazor Hosting Models: 

  Blazor Server App
  - Server side hosting model
  - Blazor executed on the Server within and ASP.NET app and the UI updates
  - Events, handling, and JavaScript calls are handled over a SingnalR connection
  - The Blazor app is not downloaded in the browser but executed on the Server
  - The user interacts with the Blazor app remotely via SingnalR connection
  - Cannot work off line
  - Uses SignalR for realtime connections between web app and server
    ** Note: If you have thousand connections, SingalR running can be taxing on the server.
  - Used like typical server application, program must be loaded on a server like IIS, ect..

  Blazor WebAssembly App
  - Client Side hosting model
  - Initial load time is slower because program is getting loaded into the browser, but after it's running from 
    the browser
  - It's dependances and the .NET runtime are downloaded to the browser meaning entire app is stored in browser
  - The blazor app is executed on the browser via WebAssembly
  - All UI updates and Event handling happens in the same process
  - Runs as a progressive web app which allows you to download it to your device (Mobile, Desktop, tablet)
  
  When to choose:
  Blazor WebAssembly                            VS                     Blazor Server
  - WebAssembly can be used in offline mode                            - Server app requires a contstant connection to the internet and would
    a Progressive web app and can be easily                              be costly to scale as it always requires a server (Con)
    scaled to multiple users as each user                              - Supported by search engines (Pro)
    downloads the app into their browser. (Pro)
  - Faster than Server App (Pro)
 
  *Note: Once you learn either WebAssembly or Server you can do the other with minor tweeks. 

  Lifecycle of a Blazor Component
  - Begin: Rendered e.g. user opens page
  - End: Destroyed e.g user moves to new page
  - Lifecycle Methods: Control the changes in component during its life time
    Methods Flow:
    Parent Renders --> SetParametersAsync --> OnInitialized/OnInitializedAsync --> OnParametersSet/OnParametersSetAsync --> 
                       State Has Changed --> ShouldRender --> OnAfterRender/OnAfterRenderAsync
                       
    Parent Remove from Render Tree --> IDisposable.Dispose --> Dispose Child Child Components
    
    SetParametersAsync: Executed whenever the parent renders
    - Used to set paramenters supplied by the parent to the child component in the components render tree
    - Holds any default parameter values that need to be declared to the child
    
    OnInitialized / OnInitializedAsync
    - Executed when a component is initialized
    - Used to load all data necessary before loading UIs, each control in the UI is loaded AFTER this method
    - Executed when component is recieves values from the parent in the render tree
    - Excuted only once when the component is first created and if at a later time the component parameters change, this method will be skipped

    OnParametersSet / OnParametersSetAsync
    - Executed when the component receives parameters from its parent when rendered for the first time
    - When parent rerenders and supplies the new changes in the parameters to the child component
    
    State Has Changed 
    - Notifies the component that its state has changed usually after user interaction
    - This method looks at the value returned from ShouldRender to decide if a UI re-render should happen
    - Called automatically for event call back methods and cause components to be re-rendered when nessary

    ShouldRender (After state has changed)
    - Returns a boolean value to refresh the UI if true, the app UI is refreshed
    - If returns false the next task is executed and the component tree is not recalculated
    - It is not executed for the first time the component is rendered
    - It does the initial rendering despite its return value
    
    OnAfterRender / OnAfterRenderAsync
    - Last method executed when the component tree is calculated
    - Executed after a component tree has been recalculated
    - Executed after each render of the component
    - Useful for impementing JS Interop
    - Can be used to perform an action such as attaching a event listener and requires the elements of the component to be rendered in the DOM and JS Interop
    
    Dispose
    - Executed once a component is removed from the parent's render tree
    - Implemented when a component implements the IDisposable interface
    
    ----- Additional Syntax for Blazor code --
    
    Data Binding in Blazor
    - It is a technique use to connect UI elements and the application logic
    - It is use to connect C# variables with HTML elements
    - In Blazor, data binding is done using the @bind keyword. This is also used for two-way binding.

    3 ways of binding data in Blazor
    - One way Data Binding
      * The variable name is passed with the @ sign
      * The variables is bound to the HTML elements
      * When variable value changes the HTML element automatically shows the change

    - Two way Data Binding
      * Uses the bind keyword to call a variable to the HTML element
      * Doesn't support all data types, but does support the basics (int, string, datetime, enum, bool)
	* When using the input fields don't change until the field loses focus, this is standard unless you specifically change the event 

    - Event Binding
      * This is done between and event and a method
      * It is supported for the onclick, onchange, oninput events
      
      * Events that supported in blazor
   	- Blazor supprts event handling asynchronosuly
        Event Examples:
		  - Event      - Argument           -Trigger
		    Input        ChangeEventArgs     oninput
                Mouse        MouseEventArgs      onclick
                Keyboard     KeyboardEventArgs   onkeypress

      - Event Callbacks
	  * A way for the child and parent components to communicate
	  * A parent component is notified when a child component changes by the child component exposing an event and the parent assiging a callback method to the child 
          component event.

        - [Parameter] key words denotes the target member as a component parameter. This parameter functions similar to a HTML tags attribute <NonRootableComponentName ParameterName />
	  
    - Forms & Validation
      * A form is defined using the EditForm Component
      * Among Blazor built in components are some form input components
      * Blazor provides some inbuilt form elements
        This include but not limited to:
        - Input Component           - Render
          InputText                   <input>
          InputDate<TValue>           <input type="data">
          InputCheckbox               <input type="checkbox">

      - EditForm component
       * Provides callbacks for handling form submission.
       * OnValidSubmit assigns an event handler to run when a form with valid inputs is submitted
	 * OnInvalidSubmit assigns an event handler to run when a form with invalid fields is submitted
       * The form is validated by calling EditContext.Validate in the event handler method. 
         If valid returns 'true', the form is valid
       * OnSubmit assigns an event handler to run regardless of the form fields' validation status
       
       - All EditForm components need to be assigned a model and OnSubmit attribute equaling a method that does something
       - You verify forms by using data annotations on the model
       - In the EditForm you must enable data annotations validations by adding the <DataAnnotationsValidator /> and <ValidationSummary /> components

     - Layouts
       * Are components that can be reused across different pages in the app while only modifying their contents
         - A layout has two special aspects
          * Inhearts from LayoutComponentBase                                                                                                                                                                          
          * Contains the @Body property
          * A layout page is created the same as a regular blazor component. To make it a layout you must add the @inherits LayoutComponentBase 
       * To add a layout to a page you use the @layout NameOfNewLayoutComponent

	- CSS Isolation in Blazor
        * Separate CSS sytles for individual components, pages, or app views
	  * Improves the overall workflow of applying CSS to multiple components
  	  * This is done for two major reasons:
          - Avoid Styling conflicts among components
          - To better manage dependencies in global styles
        
        - How to Isolate CSS
          * Is enabled when a razor component of the same name is added to the same folder but with an .css at the end.
            Example: MyComponent.razor -> MyComponent.razor.css 
		- This is called a 'Scope' css file
	      - The CSS will only apply to this razor page
          
        - CSS Isolation Bundling: Blazor rewrites CSS selectors to match markup rendered by the component.
        - Child component reference
          * CSS by default is applied to the parent components
   	    * To further style the child components use the ::deep combinator before the HTML tag associated with the child element.

     - Calling a Web Api in Blazor
       * To use http request add @inject HttpClient Http
       * Any service to be injected to a component it has to be registered into the dependancy injection container located in the Startup file which is called Program.cs
          
     - Uploading Files in a Blazor Server App
       * IBrowser interface is used to select files uploaded from the browser
       * Within the form you use the InputFileChangeEventArgs that is raised when an file is selected by the browser input control
	 
	   -> What is "application/octet-stream" content type? : Sent with a header file, so if you attempt download file with a missiong extention or unknown format the 
          									 your system will recognize as a octet-stream format by default. 
										 Example: If you upload a file that doesn't have software on your system that can read it, it's content type
											    is registured as a "application/octet-stream"   

         -> What are Binary Files? : Binary files contain data in the form of bytes - not text. The headers in the binary files contain instructions on how to read the data. 
						 Only a specific computer processor or program can interpret the file and run it properly.

     - Adding JavaScript To Blazor (JavaScript Interop)
       * Calling JS functions using .NET methods and interchangeably having JS functions call .NET methods

       - Why JSInterop is necessary?
         * JavaScript is the most commonly used programming langague.
         * JavaScript runs everywhere
         * Leverage existing JS libraries
         * Require browser specific capabilities
         
       - How to execute
         * Execute JavaScript function from blazor components you must add IJSRuntime
           - This can be added in 2 ways
             1) Use the annotation [Inject] in the C# code
                Example:
                [Inject]
		    public IJSRuntime JSRuntime {get; set;}
		    * Note: This is used for injecting services into a component class
           
   		 2) Use the @inject directive in the component at the time of the component (just like a @using Systems.IO)
                Example:
                @inject IJSRuntime JS
    
         - We can excute javascript functions using two methods:
           * InvokeAsync<T>(name, args) : Invokes the "specified" JavaScript Funtion asynchronously   
   
	     * InvokeVoidAsync(name, args): Invokes the JavaScript function asynchronously, does not return a value

          Break Down of this Function: 
             T: specifies the return type the javascript function will return. It's generic
		 name: name of the JavaScript Function to be invoked
		 args: the arguments that will be passed to the JavaScript function that is invoked ie: name

         - You can also invoke C# from JavaScript using the DotNet.invokeMethodAsync() method. It returns a JabaScript "Promise".
           * What is a JavaScript Promise? A Promise is object that represents the eventual completion or failure of a async 
		 operation and it's resulting value. A promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.
             It allows you to associated handlers with async actions eventual success or failure value reasons. Lets async methods 
             return values like sync methods instead of immediately returning the 'Final' value, the async method returns 
             a 'Promise' to supply the value at some point in the future.


   - Globalization & Localization

     * Globalization: 
	 - Creating an App that supports multiple languages across the world.
	 - It adjusts its display by collecting translations from resource files and allowing the UI to work with the changes

     * Localization:
	 - Adjusting a globalized app to support a specific language.
	 - Blazor uses the Resource system to render the localized elements and rendered at runtime

     - Blazor Apps Globalized
	 * Use the @bind:culture to refer to the corresponding translation in the System.Globalization.CultureInfo. The translation is 
	   done to the user's first set preferred language

	 * Blazor has inbuilt support for browser formatted fields like date however specifically formated fields require localization


     -> Ways of Globalizing a Blazor App:

        - Invariant 						- Static
          * Used to configure the app to			  * The app's culture can be set in JabaScript
		support the invariant culture.		  * Implemented when Blazor starts with the
    	    * It is generally based on 			  applicationCulture Blazor start option.
		United States English (en-US)
  	    * Set the InvariantGlobalization 
		property to true in the app's 
		project file (.csproj)
   

	  - Dynamic							- Dynamically Set Culture by User Preference
	    * Uses the Accept-Language header 		  * Commonly used method
		set by the browser.				  * App culture is based on user selection
	    * For more than one preferred 			    from the list of languages supported
		language, order of preference 
		is used.
	    * The order of preference is used
		by the browser to set quality 
		values from 0-1 for each language
		in the header.
		
	   
- To generate HTTP client code user: NSwag
  -> Why NSwag?
     The NSwag project provides tools to generate OpenAPI specifications from existing ASP.NET Web API controllers and client code from these OpenAPI specifications. 
     The project combines the functionality of Swashbuckle (OpenAPI/Swagger generation) and AutoRest (client generation) in one toolchain. You can use NSwag for 
     Angular, Typsescript, or React as well.


 - IDE for NSwag: NSwagStudio
   1) Download and install: https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/releases
   2) Run Api Project
       - When the Swagger page appears, copy the swagger link: https://localhost:44353/swagger/v1/swagger.json
   3) Open up NSwagStudio and select the runtime that's being used (Net60 = .net 6, Net70 = .net 7, etc.)
   4) Paste swagger.json link into the "Specification URL" section then hit the "Create Local Copy Button"

   5) For "Outputs" section you check off "CSharp Client"
      ** Note: You can use this for typescript or react as well

   6) Change out the Namespace to the Name of the app.
      Example: 
         Project Name: MyApp.Blazor.Server
         NSwag Namespace: MyApp.Blazor.Server.Services.Base
         ** Note: Namespaces are just folder structure

   7) Check off options
      -> Use the base URL for the request
      -> Generate the BaseUrl property 
      -> Inject HttpClient via constructor
      -> Generate interfaces for client classes

   8) Output Section: Set up target directory according to where your project is
        Right click project go to "Copy full path" option and past into the "Output file path (empty: no file output) section
        Example: C:\MyApp.Blazor\MyApp.Blazor.csproj : is where the project is located

   9) Remove the .csproj after the last '\' and replace it to 'Services\Base' (to create those folders in your project) and add the name of the 
      file you want to create at the end 'ServiceClient.cs'
        Example: C:\MyApp.Blazor\Services\Base\ServiceClient.cs

   10) Select Generate Files button.
