Dataverse: MS DV is a cloud-based, Software as a service, low-code data service and app platform, that easily structures a veriety of data and 
business logic to support interconnected applications and processes in a secure and compliant manner. DV based of the definitions and schema of Common Data Model 

Out the box:
- security
- logic
- data
- stroage
- integration

Data Model Overview
- Data modeling: A process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support the business processes
- Definitions
  * Table: Containner for data
  * Column: Containner for a piece of data in a table
  * Relationship: Construct defining an association between two tables
  * Metadata: Definitions for tables, columns, and relationships

benifits
- Simple to manage: Both the metadata and data are stored in the cloud. 
- Helps to secure data; data is tored so that users can see it only if you grant them access. Role based
  security allows you to control access to tables for different suers within your org
- Access your D365 data: data from your D365 app is also stored within DV, which allows you to quickly build 
  apps that use your D365 and extend your apps by using Power Apps
- Rich metadata : Data ytpes and relationsophs are used directly in PA
- Logic and validation: Define caluclations columns, business rules, workflows, and business process flows to 
  ensure data quality and drive business process
- productivity tools: talbes avalable within the add in for micorsoft excel

Logic and validation
- Tables within Dataverse can leverage rich server-side logic and validation to ensure data quality
  * Business rules: Biz rules validate data across multiple cloumns in a table, and provide warning 
    error messages, aregardlesss of the app that's used to createthe data
  * Business process flows: business process flows guide users to ensure they enter data consistently and follow
    the same steps every time. Business process flows are currently supported only for model-driven apps
  * Workflow: Dataverse classic workflows automate business processes without requiring user interaction
  * Business logic with code: Business logic supports advance developer scenarios that extend the application
    directly through code

Type of tables
- Standard: create and edit rows
- Activity: used to track interactions on standard tables
- Virtual: connect to tables in an external data source. emable the intergation of data residing in 
           external systems by seamlessly representing that data as tables in MS DV without replication of 
 	   data and often without custom coding
- Elastic: handle large volumes of data
**Note: Create a custom table:
   - User or team owned: actions that can be performed on these rows can be controlled at the user level
   - Organization-owned: Access to the data is controlled by org

Calculated and rollup columns
simple column: 
- contains data not based on formula
  ex: first name, bday, email
calculated column:
- contains calculation that use columns from current table or related parent table
  ex: full name (first name + last name)
Rollup column
- contains an aggregate value computed the rows related to a row in a one to many relationship
  ex: potiential revenu (Sum of revenues of all open oppertunities for a given account)

Power Effects (Fx) Formula columns
- display a calculated value
- values are read-only
- Use power fx formulas
- supported data types
   * text
   * decimal
   * yes/no
   * date time

Security Roles in Microsoft Dataverse
- Security Model building blocks
	- Teams
	- Business units
	- Security roles
	- column-level security
	- access teams
	- Hierachy security

Security roles are group s of permissions that you can assig to a user to grant them
access and various capabilities and functionality like read,
- Sys Admin
- Sys Customizer
- Environment maker
- basic user
- app opener

Max Length of a sigle line of text is 4k with a default of 100 characters. 
Max Length of multiple lines of text is 1 mil with a default of 2k

File Length between 1KB and 131k DB
Image length 1KB and 30k KB with default 10240 KB

When creating a new column for a table the "Searchable" option allows for that column to be available in "Advance Find" feature.
Uncheck searchable reduces the number of options that are shown to people using "Advance Find"

Primary Column is nto the same as Unique Identifier key column. The Unique identifier column bears the same name as the table.
ie. Person table the primary key column will have the name "Person" and is a GUID. You can only update the schema name and display
name of the Primiary column until you create the table, after that you can't update the schema name. 

Restrictions that apply to columns in a table.
- No upper limit, depends on how much data stored in a single record.
- Have less than a few hundred columns in a table
* Rollup column limitations
  -  Max of 10 for each table
  - Max of 100 for each organization
  - Can't trigger workflows of flows
  - Can't reference another rollup column, complex calculated / formula column. Must be a simple column
  - ModifiedBy and ModifiedOn columns are not updated when rollup column is updated
  - Can't include records in N:N (many to many) relationships, only 1:N (one to many)
  - Can't use 1:N relationships with the ActivityPointer or ActivityParty table
 
Auto Number Columns
  - String prefixed number (Fat-100, Fat-101,...)
  - Date prefixed number (2019-26-02-1000, 2019-27-02-1000,...)
  - Custom: Allows for for a combination of string constants, auto incrementing numbers, formatted dates, random alphanumeric sequences.
* You can also set the seed value to start at a particular number

Alternate Key: You can use this when your org has a unique value for each record already. This key is added to the already created 
		   primary Key that's standard and a GUID. DV automatically makes the alternate Key unique so no dups can be entered.
