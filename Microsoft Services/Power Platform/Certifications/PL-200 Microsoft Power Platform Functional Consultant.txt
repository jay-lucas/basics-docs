Describe the business value of PP

PP makes it easy for orgs to address challenges:
- High app demand vs limited resources
- hanging workforce expectations 
- increase cost for custom app dev
- need to be agile
- need to scale dev efficiently

Adv of PP
- Cost saving 
- increase performance and efficiency
- help orgs build slutions that meet their changing needs

Connectors
with pp, data connectors make sorking with different data sources easier. they act as the bridge between data sources and your app or workflow

MS dataverse
MS dataverse allows orgs to securely store and manage data uses by you business apps

Benifits of Dataverse
- easy to manage
- easy to securire
- rich metadata 
- logic and validation
- productivity tools

All PP components can be used with MS Teams

- Power BI for Teams: Share reports, create templates, and bring Bpower BI into Teams
- Power APp for teams: Build, edit, and shrae apps directly within Teams
- Power automate for teams: Automate tasks within the teams environments
- Dataverse for teams: low code data platform for app, bot, and flow dev
- Copiloit for Teams: 

Describe how PP work with MS Dynamics 365 apps

Model-driven applications:
All dynamic customers engagement app are what are referred to as model-driven apps. MDA are built using Power apps. They are based on a data model strore withing DV

PP components use by D365 engagement app can include:
- power BI: connects to D365 offers business analytic and insight
- Power auto: Business process flows guild work in D365
- Power Pages: create self-support portals for customer engagements

Azure services can be used with PP to help modernize legacy systems, automate processes, and create advanced analytical solutions
- the example demos how you can deploy portals to automate manual or paper based processes and surface a richer user experience. 
  Employ Azure API management and azure functions to connect customes apis, whicht tap into your legacy systems
  by using azure- managed databases and low code approcach to automate tasks, you can lower the over all solution costs
  you can quickly build apps that are real-time, resilient and scalable

Explore how microsoft PP apps work together
- PP can add value to any business by heloing you analytize, act, and automate
- Act by building custom apps in power apps, automate processes based on the data you collect in Power automate, 
  and analyze the data you have collected in power BI

Example: Equipment check-out system
- Power apps: Build an app with equipment listings, status, and instructions
  Employees can check out equipment via the app
- power Automate: Sends reminders for equipment return. Tracks equipment bookings
- Power BI: Analyzes data to optimize equipment usage and procurement

MS Copilot uses AI. Copilot can be used throughout the MS PP. 
- Simplify app createion: The mist basic way copolit assist orgs is with app building
- Use Copilot in power apps: by embedding the copilot control inside canvas and model-driven app, 
  you can provide your users with an AI-powered expreience

PP security and governance
Data loss prevention and prevention policies: Safeguard orgs data to prevent unintentioanl exposure
- Connectors can be classified:
 * business (ex: PII, Sensitive numbers)
 * Non-business (ex: catalogs, surveys)
 * blocked (ex: social media)

Compliance and data privacy
- MS is committed to the hightest level of trust, transparency, standard conformance, and regulatory compliance

Accessibility in Microsoft PP
One of the things MS values the most is making sure that PP is accessible and inclusive to all Kinds of users all over the world.

Explore MS Dataverse
- Dataverse incorporates security, logic, data, and storage into a central point
  - Scalability: a Dataverse database supports large data sets and complex data models
  - MS DV structure and benifits: The structure of a MS DV database is based upon the definitions and schema in the common data model. 
    It simplifies the integration of solutions that use a Common data model schema.
  - Describe tables, columns, and relationships:
    * Talbes: a table is a logical strucutre containing rolws and columns that represents a set of data. The 3 types of tables are
	      standard, managed, and custom
    * Columns: columns store a discrete piece of info within a row in a table
    * Relationships: Efficiently split data into different containers (tables)

Types of Connectors: Tabular data and Function-based data
Connectors:
-  are the bridges from your data source to your app, workflow, or dashboard
- can provide input and output between the data source and PP which can accelerate the delivery of MS PP business solutins
- are devided into standard and premium

After the data source is established and the connectors is confg, two type of operations can be used
- triggers aare only used in Power Automate and prompt a flow to begin
- Actions are used in Power Automate and Power Apps

Environments
- Default: Each tenant has a default environment that's created automatically - All licensed users have access
- Production: For permanent work, requires 1GB of available database capacity - Full Control
- Sandbox: Non-production used for development and testing. Requires 1gb of database cap. Can be resent and converted to prod - Full Control
- Trial: for short term testing and proof of concepts, deletes after 30 days - Full Control
- Developer: Special environments intended only for use by owner - Limited control, security groups can't be assigned to developer environments
- Dataverse for Teams: Automatically created for the selected team when you create an app in Teams - Limited control for members of the team

** Exam Tips: Recover an environment within 7 days of deletion
         You can backup all environments except Trial

Calculated and rollup column data types
Calculated columns
- single line of text
- choice
- yes/no
- whole number
- decimal
- currency
- date time

Rollup columns
- whole number
- decimal 
- currency 
- date time

Limitations
Calculated
- Calculated on retrieve
- Can use columns on table and columns in many to many relationships

Role up
- Max 100 per environment
- Max 10 per table
- Recalculated every hour
- requires a one to many relationship

Values are read only
- values not audited
- do not trigger workflow, code, or power auto cloud flows
- calculated columns cannot contain a calculated column from another table that also contain
  another column from a different table

Administration Options in MS DV
Analytics
- The PP admin center provides various tools that administrators can use for managing their power platform tenants
  * Dataverse: Provides analysis on important details related to your different dataverse instances deployed in 
               your environment such as active users, API calls, mailbox usage and more
  * Power Apps: Provides analysis related to power apps performance information such as app locations, connectors
		details, and more
  * Power Automate: provide

Tenant storage capacity

- MS DV support custom retention policies to securely retain unlimited data log term cost efficently
* Configuration
  - Enable table for long term data retention on the table options
  - Set up retention policy

- You can connect to multiple data sources, but main sources are:
  * Dataverse
  * Sharepoint
  * Excel
  * Azure SQL Server
