What is Power Platform?
- The Microsoft Power Platform is a powerful set of applications that allow you to automate processes, 
   build solutions, analyze data, and create virtual agents. This blog and video will introduce the various 
   components of the Power Platform, discuss how you can harness the power of data and discover the impact 
   these solutions have when integrated with other Microsoft solutions.

Microsoft Power Platform consists of the following components:
  -> Power Apps
  -> Power Automate
  -> Power BI
  -> Power Pages
  -> Copilot Studio


- Power App
  Provides a a rapid low code development environment for building custom apps for business needs. It has
  services, connectors, and a scalable data service and app platform, known as the "Microsoft Dataverse",
  to allow simple integration and interaction with existing data. Power Apps enables the creation of web 
  and mobile applications that run on all devices.
  * Canvas Apps
    Canvas apps are ideal for creating custom interfaces and user experiences. They are highly flexible and can be designed from scratch to 
    fit the exact requirements of a business. With canvas apps, users can drag and drop different elements onto the canvas, such as data tables, 
    forms, charts, and multimedia. This allows businesses to create apps tailored to their unique needs and workflows.
    ** Note: Canvas apps are ideal for companies that must create custom interfaces and user experiences

    Another advantage of canvas apps is that they are highly visual and interactive, making them ideal for customer-facing apps. They can be accessed 
    via a web browser or mobile device, providing users a seamless experience across different platforms.

  * Model-Driven Apps
    Model-driven apps are best suited for businesses that manage complex data models and processes. They are built on the Dataverse fka Common Data Service, which 
    provides a centralized data storage and management repository. This allows businesses to create tightly integrated apps with their data and processes, 
    making them highly efficient and scalable.
    ** Note: model-driven apps are best suited for managing complex data models and processes

    Model-driven apps also come with various pre-built components and templates, such as forms, views, and dashboards. This makes it easy for businesses to 
    start with app development, as they can start from scratch.

- Power Automate
  Lets users create automated workflows between applications and services. It helps automate repetitive 
  business processes such as communication, data collections, and decision approvals. 

- Power BI (Business Intelligence)
  A business analytics service that delivers insight for analyzing data. It can share those insights 
  through data visualizations which make up reports and dashboards to enable fast, informed decisions.
  Power BI scales across an organization, and it has built-in governance and security allowing businesses
  to focus on using data more than managing it.
  
- Power Pages
  Power Pages are a hybrid of canvas and model-driven apps, combining the flexibility of canvas apps with the data management capabilities 
  of model-driven apps. They are canvas apps with added data integration and management features.
  Power Pages are ideal for businesses that need to build highly visual and data-driven apps. They are handy for creating custom portals, 
  intranet sites, and dashboards that provide users with a unified view of their data and processes.  
  ** Note: Power Pages are a good option for businesses that need the best of both worlds of Canvas App and Model Driven App.
  
- Copilot Studio
  Enagles anyone to create powerful chatbots using a guided, no-code graphical interface, without the need
  for data scientists or developers. It minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom
  solution by empowering subject matter experts (SME) to build and maintain their own conversational 
  solutions. 

Other Power Platform Features
  - AI Builder
    Lets users and developers add AI capabilities to the workflows and Power Apps they create and use. 
    AI Builderis a turnkey solution that allows you to easily add intelligence to your workflows and apps 
    and predict outcomes to help improve business performance without writing code.

  - Microsoft Dataverse
    A scalable data service and app platform which lets users securely store and manage data from multiple
    sources and integrate that data in business applications using a common data model to ensure ease and
    consistency to users. Microsoft Dataverse is the common currency that enables the components of 
    Microsoft Power Platform to work together. It's the foundation that enables the consolidation, display, 
    and manipulation of data.

  - Connectors
    Enables you to connect apps, data, and devices in the cloud. Consider connectors the bridge across which
    information and commands travel. There are more than 600 connectors for Microsoft Power Platform, enabling
    all of your data and actions to connect cohesively. Examples of popular connectors include Salesforce, O365,
    Twitter, Dropbox, Google services, and more.
