Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- The theory and development of computer systems that normally require human intelligence

Machine Learning (ML)
- The process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without supervision

Generative AI (GenAI)
- Type of AI that broadly describes machine learning systems capable of generating text, images, code, or other types of content.
  A category of articial intelligence that uses neutral language inputs to produce human augmented data or content through trained patterns and structure recognition models. 
  The results is a combination of content output/artifact based on the criteria requested.

  Commerical GenAi use a machine learning algorithm to learn the patters and structure of training data inputs to generate new data that has similiar characteristics
  Can be used for a veriety of tasks: speech recognition, machine translation, natural language generation, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, 
  information retrieval, and others

** Note: AI is the discipline; Machine learning is a subset of AI and GenAI is a subset of ML
