What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- AI is a broad field for the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence:
    * Perception
    * Reasoning
    * Learning
    * Problem solving
    * Decision-making

- An umbrella-term for various techniques
* In order of parent to child:
   > Inside Artificial Intelligence is 
     > Machine Learning inside ML is
       > Deep Learning inside DL is 
         > Generative AI

Use Cases
- Computer Vision for self driving cars
- Facial Recognition
- Fraud Detection
- Intelligence Document Processing (IDP)

AI Components
- Data Layer: collect vast amount of data (Data Engineer + Data)
- Machine Learning (ML) and Algorithm Layer: data scientist and engineer work together to understand use cases, requirements, and frameworks that can solve them
- Model Layer: implement a model and train it, we have the structure, the parameters and functions, optimizer function.
- Application Layer: how to serve the model, and its capabilities for your users
