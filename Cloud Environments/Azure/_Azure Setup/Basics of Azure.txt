Azure Policy Best Practices

- Start with an audit effect instead of a deny effect: 
  Why: If you have any automation a deny effect may stop the process when an audit effect allows us to see what would happen while still allowing the process to continue before enforcing deny actions. 
- Consider organizational hierarchies
- Try creating and assigning initiative definitions even for a single policy definition
- When an initiative assignment is evaluated, all policies within the initiative are also evaluated
