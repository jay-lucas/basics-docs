Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized 
  for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to 
  a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

  Access objects in Blob storage via HTTP/HTTPS and are accessible via the Azure Storage Rest API,
  Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an Azure Storage client library (.NET, Java, Node.js, Python, Go).
  Clients can also securely connect to Blob storage by using SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and 
  mount Blob Storage containers by using the Network File System (NFS) protocol.

  -> Blob Storage is designed for:
     * Serving images or documents directly to a browser
     * Storing files for distributed access
     * streaming video and audio
     * Writing to log files
     * Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
     * Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

   * Blob storage offers 3 types of resources
     -> The storage account 
     -> A container in the storage account
     -> A blob in a container
