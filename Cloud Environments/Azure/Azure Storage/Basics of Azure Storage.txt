What can you do with Azure Storage?
- Create storage accounts up to 5 PB each
- Blobs, queues, tables, files
- various levels of replication included from local to global
- Storage tiers (hot, cool, archive   
- Manged (for VMs) or unmanaged)

Steps to move a storage account to another region
1) Export the storage template
2) Modify the template by changing the target region and the storage account name
3) Create a new template deployment
4) Deploy the template to the target region
5) Use the AzCopy tool to copy the data 

Data Storage
- Containers: Blob files 
- File shares: traditional mounted storage that can be shared across CPU or servers
- Queues
- Tables


Redundancy:
- Locally-redundant storage (LRS): Cheapest, most basic options
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
- Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)

**Note: All storage accounts have 3 copies automatically created for disaster recovery.
