Azure Container Registry (ACR)
    - Is a managed registry service based on Docker. Create and maintain Azure Container registries to store and managed
    container images and related artifacts. ACR can be used with existing container development and deployment pipelines
    or use Azure Container Registry Task to build on demand, or fully automate builds with triggers with container images 
    in Azure.
