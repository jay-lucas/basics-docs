Instance Groups
- How do you create a group of VM instances?
  * Instance Group - Group of VM instances managed as a single entity
    -> Manage group of similiar VMs having similar lifecycle as ONE UNIT
- Two Types of Instance Groups:
  * Managed: Identical VMs created using a template that's either stateful or stateless:
    -> Features: Auto scaling, auto healing and managed releases
  * Unmanaged: Different configuration ofr VMs in same group:
    -> Does NOT offer auto scaling, auto healing & other services
    -> NOT Recommended unless you need different kinds of VMs
- Location can be Zonal or Regional
    * Regional gives you higher availability (Recommended)

Managed Instance Group (MIG)

Creating a Managed Instance Group
- What is need to create a managed instance group?
  * Instance template (mandatory)
  * Configure auto-scaling to automatically adjust number of instances based on load:
    -> Minimum number of instances
    -> Maximum number of instances
    -> Autoscaling metrics: CPU utilization target or Load Balancer Utilization target or any other metric from Stack Driver
       ** Note: Stack Driver: Monitoring tool
       - Cool-down period: How log to wait before looking at auto scaling metrics again?
       - Scale in Controls: Prevent a sudden drop in number of VM instances
         Example: Don't scale in by more than 10% of 3 instances in 5 minutes
    -> Autohealing: Configure a health check with initial delay (How log sould you wait for your app to initialize before running a health check?

Updating a Managed Instance Group 
- Rolling update: Gradual update of instances in an instance group to the new instance template
  * Specify new template:
    -> Speficy a template for canary testing (Optional)
  * Specify how you want the update to be done:
    -> When should the update happen?
       - Start the update immediately (proactive) or when instance group is rezied later (Opportunistic)
    -> How should the update happen?
       - Maximum surge: How many instances are added at any point in time?
       - Maximum unavailable: How many instances can be offline during the update?
- Rolling Restart/Replace: Gradual restart or replace of all instances in the group
  * No change in template BUT replace / restart existing VMs
  * configure Maximum surge, maximum unavailable and what you want to do? (restart/replace)
