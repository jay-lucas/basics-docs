Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service translates human readable domain names (www.example.com) into numeric IP addresses. 

How DNS Queries work?
1) The host sends a DNS request (query)  to the DNS servers
2) The DNS server is pre-configured with a list of Root nameservers randomly selects one root nameserver called a 'A record' (www.example.com) to an IP address
3) The root nameserver responds with a list of authoritative name servers for the 
.com zone along with a list of the IP addresses.
4) The DNS Server randomly selects one of the authoritative name servers and sends another DNS Query to the A record to the Top Level Domain (TLD) Authoritative Nameservers.
5) The TLD Auth Nameserver responds to the DNS servers query with a list of name servers that are authoritative to the example.com domain
6) DNS Server randomly selects one of that authoritative nameservers from the TLD auth nameserver list and sends another query to the A record example.com
7) Since the domain server is an authoritative nameserver for example.com the Nameserver sends the IP value of the A record back to the DNS Server
8) The DNS server sends the IP address for example.com back to the host which enables the host computer to connect to example.com
