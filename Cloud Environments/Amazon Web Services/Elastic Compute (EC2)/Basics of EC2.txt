Lesson: Create amazon ec2 instances to run the computational modules for an island's stabilization system, placing each instance in a different availability zone of the same AWS region.

EC2 is a web service that provides secure resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 eliminates the need to invest in upfront hardware investments so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can launch as many or few virtual servers as needed allowing you to scale up and down within minutes allowing you to handle changes or spikes in requirements reducing your need to forecast traffic. EC2 provides you with complete control of your resources running on AWS proven reliable scalable computing environment. AWS EC2 is hosted on multiple locations worldwide comprised of AWS regions consist of at least 3 availability zones. EC2 provides high availability with service level agreement (SLA) of 99.99% or each EC2 region. EC2 is built to meets the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.
