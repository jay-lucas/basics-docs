Lesson: Create amazon ec2 instances to run the computational modules for an island's stabilization system, placing each instance in a different availability zone of the same AWS region.

EC2 is a web service that provides secure resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 eliminates the need to invest in upfront hardware investments so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can launch as many or few virtual servers as needed allowing you to scale up and down within minutes allowing you to handle changes or spikes in requirements reducing your need to forecast traffic. EC2 provides you with complete control of your resources running on AWS proven reliable scalable computing environment. AWS EC2 is hosted on multiple locations worldwide comprised of AWS regions consist of at least 3 availability zones. EC2 provides high availability with service level agreement (SLA) of 99.99% or each EC2 region. EC2 is built to meets the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.

EC2 Features:
- Create and manage lifecycle of EC2 instances
- Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple EC2 instances
- Attach storage (& network storage) to your EC2 instances
- Manage network connectivity for an EC2 instance


An instance is a virtual server in the cloud. AWS provides multiple instant types that allow you to configure the following:
- CPU 
- Memory
- Storage
- Network
- GPU 

Instant Type Categories:
- General Purpose: provide balance of CPU, Memory, and Network.
  Use Case: Web Servers

- Compute Optimized: Optimized for Compute intensive workloads.
  Use Case: Game Server

- Memory Optimized: Memory intensive workloads that process large datasets in 
  Use Case: Big Data analytics

- Storage Optimized: Designed for workloads that require sequential read & write access to very large datasets on local storage
  Use Case: Data warehousing

- Accelerated computing: GPU instances that use hardware accelerators
  Use Case: Machine/Deep Learning

- HPC Optimized: Used for High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads
  Use Case: Complex Simulations

Each instance type includes one or more instance sizes allowing you to scale your resources to the requirement of the target workload.

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information needed to launch an preconfigured instance. It is a template that contains the software configuration such as a operation system (OS), Applications, and an application server. You must specify an AMI when launching a instance. You can launch one or more instances from an AMI. 

EC2 Storage and Networking.
EC2 provide data storage options for instances. Instances can access storage that are physically attached to disk to the host computer referred to Instance store. Instance store provides temporary block level storage. EC2 instances can also attach Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume for persistence block level storage. EBS acts like a raw, unformatted external block device. 

EBS data can be stored using EBS snapshots and stored in S3. EC2 also uses S3 for storing Amazon Machine Images (AMI).
You can also create a file system within a EC2 using Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) which provides scalable file storage. Applications running on EC2 instances can access your files from EFS at the same time. 

Networking is defined for access to EC2 instances. virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated area within the AWS cloud where EC2 instances can be launched in a virtual network that is defined. 

An AWS account comes with a pre-configured VPC in a aws region that you can launch EC2 instances immediately. VPC can span multiple availability zones (AZ) in a region. Subnets can be added to different AZ and EC2 instances can be launched into those Subnets to improve fault tolerance in your applications. You can use multiple levels of security to control access to EC2 instances within a subnet. Example, a security group can be configured that acts like a virtual firewall that controls traffic for your instances. 

To launch an EC2 instance:
1) Determine if you want to launch EC2 instances in a single location or multiple locations region and AZs. 
2) Select an AMI 
3) Determine instance type and sizes
4) Specify and configure network access and specify any preferred subnets on the EC2 instance
5) Add Storage
6) Add tagging
7) Configure security groups
8) Secure login information using key pairs of Public and Private keys
9) launch EC2 instance

A default root storage is used to boot up the EC2 instance. the root volume can be edited to add additional storage or tagging. Tagging is used to categorize resources that helps in searching and managing resources.

Connections to EC2
Option 1) Connected to using Session manager. Session manager provides secure node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys

Option 2) Connect through Secure Shell (SSH) clients by using terminal software on the user's local device. To access the instance, SSH requires a key pair, which must be managed and shared.  

Option 3) Connect through EC2 Instance Connect in which AWS identity and Access management (IAM) policies and principles are used to control SSH access to the instances, removing the need to share and manage SSH Keys. 

When creating an EC2.
- Baseline usage refers to the minimum amount of servers during nonpeak time. 
- Peak usage represents the amount of servers required at peak periods.

- Payment options: 
  * Standard Reserved Instance: Offers a hight discount, but allows modifications only within the same instance family, for example, t3.medium to t2.large. 

  * Convertible Reserved Instance: provides a lower discount, but allows modification across different instance families, operating systems, and tenancy configurations. 1 to 3 year commitment

  Elastic Block Store setup:
  Input/output per second (IOPS) is a unit of measurement that represents the number of IO operations that can be performed per second on an EBS volume

Snapshot Frequency: you can backup the data on amazon EBS volumes by making point-in-time copies known as EBS snapshots. Snapshots are incremental backups, which only save the blocks on the volume that has changed wince the last snapshot. this minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data.  

Data Transfer: When transferring data from AWS to the internet, the costs vary based on the region where AWS resources are located, with region-specific pricing structures. Data transfer between AWS regions follow a specific cost structure in which inbound transfer to a region is generally free and outbound transfer from one region to another incurs charges that depend on the originating region. 

Optional: Add Support helps with technical issues and additional guidance to operate infrastructures in the AWS Cloud. You pay for assistance from AWS.
