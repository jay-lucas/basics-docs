What is Helm?
Helm  is the package manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the best way to find,
share, and use software built for Kubernetes. Helm and Kubernetes work 
like a client/server application. The Helm client pushes resources to the
Kubernetes cluster via kubernetes API.

Helm charts are Helm packages that consists of YAML template files 
organized into a specific directory structure. Charts are easy to 
create, version, share, and publish and are reusable by anyone for any 
environment, which reduces complexity and duplicates. 

The three basic concepts  of Helm charts are:

Chart is a Helm package and contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster.

Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster.

Repository is the place where charts can be collected and shared for Kubernetes packages.
