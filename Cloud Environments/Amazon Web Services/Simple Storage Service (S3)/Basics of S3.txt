Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) overview
S3 is an Object Storage Service, objects consist of data and metadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. Objects are stored in a container called S3 Bucket. Objects are uniquely identified in a S3 Bucket by a key. 
Example:
a photo: photos/puppy.jpg is stored in a johnsmith s3 bucket. This is addressable using: johnsmith.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg
S3 can be used to store and protect various use cases like websites, mobile apps, enterprise apps, backups/restore archives, IoT devices, and big data analytics.
S3 can autoscale storage resources caused by fluctuating demands. Data durability 11 9's (99.999999999%) and automatically creates and stores copies of all S3 objects. 
S3 secure from unauthorized access using encryption features and Access Management Tools.
S3 Block Public Access can block public assess at the object in bucket or account level. 
S3 maintains compliance programs just as:
- PCI-DSS
- FedRAMP
- HIPAA/HITECH
- FISMA
- EUData Protection Directive
to meet regulatory requirements.
S3 has auditing capabilities to monitor access requests to S3 resources. 
S3 has a wide range of storage classes
- S3 Standard: Frequently Accessed data
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Unknown or changing data access patterns, moves data from frequent access and infrequent access tier based on the patterns without performance impact or operational overhead 
- S3 Standard-IA,
- S3 one zone-IA: infrequently accessed data, stores data in one availability zone, best for data that needs to be recreated

All about storage classes time to access in msec (milliseconds)

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval,  time to access in msec (milliseconds)
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval,  time to access in mins, free bulk retrievals 5-12 hours
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Long term data archive digital preservation,
   lowest cost storage, data retrieval 12-48 hours

S3 Storage Class analysis discover data based on access patterns should move to a lower-cost storage class. from the analysis a S3 Lifecycle policy can be configured to make the data transfer to the new storage class. 
S3 Lifecycle Policy defines when transitions to another storage class and when the objects expires.
s3 Cross-region replication (CRR) replicates data into other aws regions
s3 same region replication replicates data into the same region 

S3 object lock is when objects are locked within a retention period that is defined. You can enforce write-once-read-many (WORM) policies 

S3 Inventory report list all stored object, metadata, and encryption status.
S3 batch Operations to change object properties and perform storage management tasks. Copy objects, replace object tag sets, modify access controls, and restore objects from amazon s3 glacier. 

S3 works with AWS Lambda to log activities, create alerts, and automate workflows without additional infrastructure. 

Query-in-place services for analytics, you can run big data analytics across s3 objects and other datasets. 

Amazon Athena allows you to query s3 data with standard SQL expressions. 
Amazon Redshift Spectrum run SQL queries in S3 directly against data at rest for complex queries for large data up exabytes(EB) or 1 Million GB

S3 Select allows you to retrieve subsets of data instead of the entire object which can be up to 5 terabytes (TB) in size

S3 Buckets has versioning feature; Bucket states can be Unversioned (default), Versioning-enabled, Version-suspended.
Once a bucket is versioned it can never return to an unversioned state.
Suspending a version suspends the creation of version Id for new objects. 
Once versioning is enabled the bucket is identified by a version ID.

S3 Access Management.
by default all buckets and objects are private, which only the creator can access. An access policy must be granted to others for them to gain access.
Access Policies can be categorized into 2 groups:
- Resource-based Policies (attached to buckets, objects)
  -> Bucket Policies (written in JSON)
  -> Access Control List (ACLs) (written in XML)
  -> Query string authentication (time-limited URLs, Temporary access)
- User Policies (attached to users)(written in JSON)
  -> granted using Identity and access management (IAM) policies. IAM controls entities are Users, groups, Roles.

ACLs are a legacy policy feature, recommend you use Bucket and IAM policies
