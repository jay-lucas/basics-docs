Security Groups
- Used for managing the firewall of what goes in and out. 
- Security groups can allow other security groups inbound 


Classic Ports to know
- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
- 443 = HTTPS - access secure websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance

**Pro Tip: Any time a timeout happens when trying to have any kind of connection to an EC2 it's 100% because of the security group in the inbound rules.
