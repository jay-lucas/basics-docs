With DynamoDB you can create a NoSQL database, so you don't have to worry about a well defined schema. The database automatically scales and has a sing;e-digit millisecond. DyanamoDB supports petabytes of data and to support metadata needs, you can add records with unique IDs that have varying attributes. 

DynamoDB tables support two types of primary keys: a primary key that uses only the partition key, or a composite key that combines a partition key with a sort key.
