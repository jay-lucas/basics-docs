Test access to the webpage hosted on Amazon S3


Amazon Cloud Computing Resources are hosted in multiple world wide locations called AWS Regions. Each region is a separate geographic area that has multiple isolated locations called Availablity zones (AZ). Each region has atleast 2 AZ.
Availability Zones are completely isolated for complete redundancy. Each AZ is comprised of 1 or more discrete data centers, typically 3.

Points of Presence (PoP)
Amazon CloudFront: global Content Delivery Network (CDN)
AWS CloudFront allows customers to deliver their data content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds through a network of PoP locations which consist of "edge locations" and regional edge cache servers

Availability Zone makes partitioning applications easy. this protects applications from natural disasters. An Elastic Load Balancer is used to distribute traffic across AZs.   

What is AWS Well-Architected?
Helps architects design infrastructure built around six pillars: 
- Operational excellence: Monitor systems, improve processes
- Security: Protects information and systems
- reliability: Ensure workloads, recover failures
- Performance efficiency: Select resources (types, sizes, performance, efficiency)
- Cost Optimization: understand trends, control spending
- Sustainability: Minimizes Impact (energy consumption, Resource use)

AWS Well-Architected includes, 
- hands-on labs
- Aws well-architected partner program
- Aws well architected tool
   -> evaluate, identify, record



Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides reliable, scalable, compute capacity in the cloud so that you can launch virtual servers in mins.
