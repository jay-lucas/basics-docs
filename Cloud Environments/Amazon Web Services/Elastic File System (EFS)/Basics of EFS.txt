Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) a serverless, set-and-forget solution that you can use to share file data without provisioning or managing storage. With EFS you can create shared network drives so that your branches can access pet client photos from a central location, and you can restrict access with file-level permissions. EFS provides petabyte-scale storage that grows and shrinks automatically as you add and remove files. EFS is a highly available and is designed for 99.9% durability. By default every object is redundantly stored across multiple Availability Zones and is designed to sustain concurrent device failures by quickly detecting and repairing any lost redundancy. 

Amazon EFS provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic network file system (NFS) within AWS resources and on-premises resources. Manages file storage infrastructure avoiding the need to deploy, patch, maintain complex file system configurations.
