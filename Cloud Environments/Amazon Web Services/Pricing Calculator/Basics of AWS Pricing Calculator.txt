Recommendations

Have a plan for how you want to use AWS before starting an estimate. For example, decide whether you want to break out your estimate by cost center, by products to run on AWS, or by regional stacks. Then you can use the group feature to organize your estimates. 

Create Group: A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates for each cost center, product stacks, architectures, or other organizational methods.
