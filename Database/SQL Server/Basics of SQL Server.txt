What is SQL Server

- SQL Server is a relational database management system, or RDBMS, developed and marketed by Microsoft.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used to communicate with a database. SQL is the standard language for 
  relational database management systems (RDBMS)

Quering data from SQL Server

- SELECT : The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result 
  table, called the result-set. This is where you request, alter, manipulate, aggregate columns within a table.
  Examples:
    * SELECT FirstName, LastName
    * SELECT Count(LastName)
    * SELECT SUM(Price)
    * SELECT * 
      -- Note: * is used in the all the columns in all tables associated (one or many tables). Use this to start
               your queries until you finish the rest of the SQL Statement to ensure all data is present before 
               you request, alter, manipulate, aggregate columns within a table.

- FROM : This command is used to specify which table to select or delete data from. This statement is usually 
         follows immediately after the SELECT statement has been made
  Examples:
    * SELECT FirstName, LastName
      FROM Persons
    * SELECT LastName, DateOfBirth 
      FROM Persons

- WHERE : This command is used to filter a result set to include only records that fulfil a specified condition.
  Examples:
    * SELECT FirstName, LastName
      FROM Persons
	WHERE LastName = 'Hailu' 
      -- Note: In SQL Server single quotes are used to annotate text values data types (text, nvarchar, char, etc)

    * SELECT * 
      FROM Persons
      WHERE DateOfBirth > '01/20/1979'

- Functions in SQL Server
  SQL server functions are sets of SQL statements that execute a specific task. Their main use is in allowing common 
  tasks to be easily replicated. The use of SQL server functions is similar to that of functions in mathematics, in 
  that they correlate a series on inputs to a series of outputs. Functions typically require a value or column within 
  the round brackets or parentheses () to execute the task.

  Examples:
    > COUNT()
      Examples:
       * SELECT Count(*)
         FROM Persons
         -- Note: Count is a function that requires a value
