What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types. JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult 
  to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript. In JavaScript, function parameters and 
  variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the 
  implementation.
  TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report 
  errors when the types don't match.
  For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. 
  JavaScript will not.

Getting Started
1. You will need npm
2. Within your npm project run the command to install typescript: npm install typescript --save-dev
3. add the typescript configuration file tsconfig.json: npx tsc --init

Type Assignment
- When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
  * Explicit
  * Implicit
In both examples below firstName is of type string

Explicit Type
Explicit - writing out the type:

let firstName: string = "Dylan";
** Note: Having TypeScript "guess" the type of a value is called infer. Implicit assignment forces TypeScript to 
   infer the value. Implicit type assignment are shorter, faster to type, and often used when developing and testing.
   Best practice is to explicitly define your types.
