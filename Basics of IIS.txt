What is Information Services (IIS)?
- Internet Information Services (IIS) is a flexible, general-purpose web server from Microsoft that runs on Windows systems to serve requested HTML pages or files.
  An IIS web server accepts requests from remote client computers and returns the appropriate response. 
  
- This basic functionality allows web servers to share and deliver information across local area networks (LAN), such as corporate intranets, and 
  wide area networks (WAN), such as the Internet.
  
- A web server can deliver information to users in several forms, such as static webpages coded in HTML; through file exchanges as downloads and uploads; 
  and text documents, image files and more.

How IIS works
- IIS works through a variety of standard languages and protocols. HTML is used to create elements such as text, buttons, image placements, direct 
  interactions/behaviors and hyperlinks. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the basic communication protocol used to exchange information between web servers 
  and users. HTTPS -- HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) -- uses Transport Layer Security or SSL to encrypt the communication for added data security. 
  The File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or its secure variant, FTPS, can transfer files.

- Additional supported protocols include the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), to send and receive email, and the Network News Transfer Protocol, to deliver 
  articles on USENET.
