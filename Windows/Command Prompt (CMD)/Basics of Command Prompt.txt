What is Robocopy in Windows?
- Microsoft Windows’s file replication command is known as “Robust file copy” or simply called Robocopy. 
  It uses the concept of timestamp and datestamp for incomplete file transfers, that help in tolerating 
  network interruptions. It knows where to start from using that recovery record having the date/time stamp 
  information. Robocopy eliminates the chance of failure as it skips NTFS junction points as NTFS happens to 
  cause infinite loops. Robocopy replaces all other copy commands with multiple exceptional features. 
 
  The concept used in Robocopy to copy multiple files simultaneously is multithreading. The usage of 
  multithreading makes it much faster than standard copy and also Xcopy.  
  The basic syntax is: 
  	robocopy <Source> <Destination> [<File>[ ...]] [<Options>]
