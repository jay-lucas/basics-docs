Azure Cosmos DB change feed
- Enables efficient processing of large datasets with a high volume of writes. Change feed also offers
  an alternative to querying and entire dataset to identify what has changed.   

* A common design pattern for Azure cosmos DB is to use changes to the data to trigger other actions.
  -> Triggering a notification or a call to an API when an item is inserted, updated, or deleted.
  -> Real-time stream processing for IoT or real-time analytics processing on operational data.
  -> Data movement such as synchronizing with a cache, a search engine, a data warehouse, 
     or cold storage.

** Note: You can use the Change Feed processor to automatically poll your container for changes and 
         call external API each time there's a write, update or delete.

- Advantages of Azure Cosmos DB change feed over a message queue:
  * Data Persistence: Data written to Azure Cosmos DB shows up in the change feed and is retrained
                      until deleted when reading with latest version mode. Message queues typically 
                      have a maximum retention period. For example, Azure Event Hubs offers a maximum 
                      data retention of 90 days.
   
  * Querying Ability: You can run SQL queries on the data store. the change feed isn't a duplication
                      of data already in the container but rather just a different way (mechanism)
                      of reading the data. Therefore, if you read data from the change feed, it's 
                      always consistent wth queries of the same container.

  * High Availability: Azure cosmos DB offers up to 99.999% read and write availability. Unlike
                       many message queues, Azure Cosmos DB data can be easily globally distributed 
                       and configured with an Recovery time Objective (RTO) of zero.

  * Data movement: You can also read from the change feed for real-time data movement.    

  * Event Sourcing: The event sourcing pattern involves using an append-only store to record 
                    the full series of actions on that data.             

  - Change Feed Processor:
    Change feed processor is part of Azure Cosmos DB .NET V3 and Java v4 SDKs: It simplifies the process of reading the 
    change feed and distributes the event processing across multiple consumers effectively. The main benefit of change
    feed process is its fault-tolerant behavior that assures an "at-least-once" delivery of all the events in the change feed.

    * Main components of implementing the change feed processor:
       -> The monitored container: 
          The monitored container has the data from which the change feed is generated. Any inserts
          and updates to the monitored container are reflected in the change feed of the container.

       -> The lease container: 
          The lease container acts as a state storage and coordinates processing the change feed across multiple workers.
          The lease container can be stored in the same account as the monitored container or in a separate account.

       -> The compute instance:
          A compute instance hosts the change feed processor to listen for changes. Depending on the platform, it could
          be represented by a VM, a kubernetes pod, an Azure App Service instance, or an actual physical machine. It has 
          a unique identifier referenced as the instance name.

       -> The delegate:
          The delegate is the code that defines what you, the developer, want to do with each batch of changes that the 
          change feed processor reads
