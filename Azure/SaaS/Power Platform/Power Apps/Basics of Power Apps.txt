Behavior vs Non-behavior formulas

- Behavior: 
  * They change the app behavior
  * You can have a sequence of actions with these formulas
  * They 'usually' don't have return values
  * We use them with 'On..' properties 
    Example: OnSelect, OnFocus,..

- Non-behavior: 
  * They work like excel formulas
  * You can have only one formula per property
  * They don't change the app behavior
  * They return a value
  * We use them with properties that don't have 'On..' in the begaining
    Example: Fill, Text, ...

  ** Note: Typically when doing formulas in Power Apps you select a control, screen, 
	     component or evern the App it's self then select the property on the left 
           drop down that we want the formula to respond too. 


- How to Bridge between behavior and non-behavior properties?
  Answer: Use Variables!
  
  * Use Set to create varioables
    - Set([variable name], [value]):
      * Is a behavioral function
      * Can create a variable fo all data types
      * Variables are global
