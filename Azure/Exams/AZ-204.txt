App Service is a distributed system. 
Roles that handle incoming HTTP or HTTPS request are called "Front Ends".
Roles that hos the customer workload are called "Workers"

Free and Shared plans host customer workloads on multitenant Workers
Basic and higher plans host customer workloads that are dedicated to only one app service plan.

If you have a Standard App Service plan, all the apps in that plan run on the same worker. if you scale
out the worker, all the apps in that plan are replicated on a new worker for each instance.
