Docker Desktop
- Docker Desktop is a one-click-install application for your Mac, Linux, or Windows environment that 
  enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices.

- It provides a straightforward GUI (Graphical User Interface) that lets you manage your containers, 
  applications, and images directly from your machine. Docker Desktop can be used either on itâ€™s 
  own or as a complementary tool to the CLI.
