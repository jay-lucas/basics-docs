JSX works like HTML but can enter JavaScript mode by using {} (for text or attributes)

We can place JavaScript expressions inside {}.

Statements are not allows 9if/else, for, switch
JSX produces a javaScript expressions
example:
- const el = <h2>Hello React</h2>
from
- const el = React.createElement("h2", null, "Hello React")

We can place other pieces of JSX inside {}, we can also write JSX anywhere inside a component (in if/else, assign to variables, pass it into functions, etc.)

A piece of JSX can only have one root element. If you need more, use <React.Fragment> or <> for short

Notes: 
CSS inline style are written like this: {{ color: white}} or {{ color: props.color}}
