About React
- Based on Components which are the building blocks of user interfaces. Components are made to be 
  reusable
- We describe how components look like based on the current state and how they work using a declarative 
  syntax called JSX. Declarative is telling react what a component should look like based on current
  state. JSX is an abstraction away from the DOM, the dom is never touched. JSX a syntax that combines
  HTML, CSS, & JavaScript as well as referencing other components
- What Is 'State' in ReactJS? The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. 
  A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
  *Note: Piece of data is referred as Piece of state, this is also called managing state.
