- Windows Communication Foundation
  Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send 
  data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available 
  service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client of a service that requests 
  data from a service endpoint. The messages can be as simple as a single character or word sent as XML, or as complex as a 
  stream of binary data. A few sample scenarios include:
    * A secure service to process business transactions.
    * A service that supplies current data to others, such as a traffic report or other monitoring service.
    * A chat service that allows two people to communicate or exchange data in real time.
    * A dashboard application that polls one or more services for data and presents it in a logical presentation.
    * Exposing a workflow implemented using Windows Workflow Foundation as a WCF service.
