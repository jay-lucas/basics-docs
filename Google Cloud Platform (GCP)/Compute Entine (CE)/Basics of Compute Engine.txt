What is Compute Engine? 
- Is the service of provisioning and managing virtual machines in the google platform cloud.
  Features:
  * Create and manage lifecycle of Virtual Machines (VM) instances
  * Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances
  * Attach storage (% network storage) to your VM Instances
  * Manage network connectivity and configuration for your VM instances

- Creating an CE instance
  Step 1: Name the instance
  Step 2: Add Labels
    ** Note: Add Environment, business Units, ect. Add information detailing more information about the vm
  Step 3: Select Region and Zone 
    ** Note: Pick a region closes to you or your customer
  Step 4: Select the Hardware you want to run on the VM (Machine Configuration)
  Step 5: Select the Operating System (image) software you want to run on the VM (Book Disk)
  Step 6: Select Firewall
    ** Note: Allow HTTP traffic allows someone from the outside to access your VM
  Step 7: Create Instance

Important choices to make when creating a VM.
1) What is the hardware? Two important things:
   - Machince Families for different Workloads:
     -> General Purpose (E2, N2, N2D, N1): Best prince-performance ratio
        > Used for Web and application servers, small-medium databases, dev environments
     
     -> Memory Optimized (M2, M1): Ultra high memory workloads
        > Used for Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics
        
     -> Compute Optimized (C2): Compute intensive workloads
        > Used for Gaming Applications
        
   ** Note: Once you choose the machine family you select a machine type. There are a variety of machine types 
            available for each machine family. memory, disk and networking capabilites increase along with vCPUs for machine types.
   
2) What operating system and what software do you want on your VM instance?
   - Types of Images:
     -> Pulbic Images: Provided & maintained by Google or open source communities or thrid party vendors
     -> Custom Images: Created by you for your projects

- Simplify VM HTTP server setup
How do we reduce the number of steps in creating an VM instance and setting up a HTTP Server?
Options:
-> Startup script
-> Instance Template
-> Custom Image

- Startup script
  The process of installing any software or installing OS patches when an VM instance is launched is called "Bootstrapping". In VM, 
  you can configure Startup script to bootstrap.
  Step 1) Go to Compute Engine in console and select 'Instance Template' and create a new instance.
  Step 2) Configure similar to creating a new VM
          **Note: Make sure Region is the same as other VMs
  Step 3) Select the 'Advance Options' drop down and go to 'Automation' section
  Step 4) Add start up script to text area
          Example:
          #!/bin/bash
          apt update 
          apt -y install apache2
          echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
  Step 5) Select create button
