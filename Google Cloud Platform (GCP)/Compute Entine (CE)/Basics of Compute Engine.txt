What is Compute Engine? 
- Is the service of provisioning and managing virtual machines in the google platform cloud.
  Features:
  * Create and manage lifecycle of Virtual Machines (VM) instances
  * Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances
  * Attach storage (% network storage) to your VM Instances
  * Manage network connectivity and configuration for your VM instances

- Creating an CE instance
  Step 1: Name the instance
  Step 2: Add Labels
    ** Note: Add Environment, business Units, ect. Add information detailing more information about the vm
  Step 3: Select Region and Zone 
    ** Note: Pick a region closes to you or your customer
  Step 4: Select the Hardware you want to run on the VM (Machine Configuration)
  Step 5: Select the Operating System you want to run on the VM (Book Disk)
  Step 6: Select Firewall
    ** Note: Allow HTTP traffic allows someone from the outside to access your VM
  Step 7: Create Instance

Important choices to make when creating a VM.
1) What is the hardware? Two important things:
   - Machince Families for different Workloads:
     -> General Purpose (E2, N2, N2D, N1): Best prince-performance ratio
        > Used for Web and application servers, small-medium databases, dev environments
     
     -> Memory Optimized (M2, M1): Ultra high memory workloads
        > Used for Large in-memory databases and In-memory analytics
        
     -> Compute Optimized (C2): Compute intensive workloads
        > Used for Gaming Applications
        
   ** Note: Once you choose the machine family you select a machine type. There are a variety of machine types 
            available for each machine family. memory, disk and networking capabilites increase along with vCPUs for machine types.
