Instance Groups
- How do you create a group of VM instances?
  * Instance Group - Group of VM instances managed as a single entity
    -> Manage group of similiar VMs having similar lifecycle as ONE UNIT
- Two Types of Instance Groups:
  * Managed: Identical VMs created using a template that's either stateful or stateless:
    -> Features: Auto scaling, auto healing and managed releases
  * Unmanaged: Different configuration ofr VMs in same group:
    -> Does NOT offer auto scaling, auto healing & other services
    -> NOT Recommended unless you need different kinds of VMs
- Location can be Zonal or Regional
    * Regiinal gives you higher availability (Recommended)

Managed Instance Group (MIG)

Creating a Managed Instance Group
- What is need to create a managed instance group?
  * Instance template (mandatory)
  * Configure auto-scaling to automatically adjust number of instances based on load:
    -> Minimum number of instances
    -> Maximum number of instances
    -> Autoscaling metrics: CPU utilization target or Load Balancer Utilization target or any other metric from Stack Driver
       ** Note: Stack Driver: Monitoring tool
       - Cool-down period: How log to wait before looking at auto scaling metrics again?
       - Scale in Controls: Prevent a sudden drop in number of VM instances
         Example: Don't scale in by more than 10% of 3 instances in 5 minutes
    -> Autohealing: Configure a health check with initial delay (How log sould you wait for your app to initialize before running a health check?
