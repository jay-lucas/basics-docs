Creating a Managed Instance Group
- What is need to create a managed instance group?
  * Instance template (mandatory)
  * Configure auto-scaling to automatically adjust number of instances based on load:
    -> Minimum number of instances
    -> Maximum number of instances
    -> Autoscaling metrics: CPU utilization target or Load Balancer Utilization target or any other metric from Stack Driver
       ** Note: Stack Driver: Monitoring tool
       - Cool-down period: How log to wait before looking at auto scaling metrics again?
       - Scale in Controles: Prevent a sudden drop in number of VM instances
         Example: Don't scale in by more than 10% of 3 instances in 5 minutes
    -> Autohealing: Configure a health check with initial delay (How log sould you wait for your app to initialize before running a health check?

   - Managed instance group (stateless and stateful)
   - Unmanaged instance group
