What is Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Is a cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure tools and services for users to 
  build applications and services on top of. Provides (200+) on-demand services.
  

Why we need Regions and Zones
-> Scenario 1: 
   - Application is deployed in a data center in London Region.
     What would be the challenges?
     * Challenge 1: Slow access for users from other parts of the world known as "High Latency"
     * Challenge 2: What if the data center in London Region crashes?
       - Answer: Application goes down which means this architecture has "low availablity"
 
 Possible solution to Scenerio 1: Set up Multiple Data Centers
 - Add one more data center in London Region
   What would be the challenges?
   * Challenge 1: Still slow access for users from other parts of the world known as "High Latency"
   * Challenge 2: (Solved) What if the data center in London Region crashes?
      - Answer: Appication is still available from other data center
   * New Challenge: What if entire London Region goes down?
      - Answer: Application will go down
   
 Complete soultion to Scenerio 1: Set up Multiple Regions with Multiple Data Centers per region
  - Add new Mumbai Region
   What would be the challenges?
   * Challenge 1: (Solved) Slow access for users from other parts of the world
     ** Note: if there are an influx of users in other parts of the world, say New York, you would like add another Region in New York
   * Challenge 2: (Solved) What if the data center in London Region crashes?
      - Answer: Appication is still available from other data center
   * Challenge 3: (Solved) What if entire London Region goes down?
      - Answer: Application is served from Mumbai

What is a Region:
- A region is a specific geographical location to host your resources
  ** Note: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides 20+ regions around the world. 
           Advantages of Multiple regions:
           * High Availability: If a region in one area is down you have can serve the application from another region.
           * Low Latency: You can serve users from the nearest region to them
           * Global Footprint: You can deploy an application, once a region is set up, to multiple parts of the world
           * Adhere to government regulations: Different contries have different regulations. You can regulate data going to other regions.
  
What is a Zone and it's needs?
- Each Region has at lease 3 Zones. This increases availability and fault tolerance within same the region
- Each Zone has one or more discrete clusters and are connected through "Low-Latency" links.
  * Cluster: distinct physical infrastructure that is housed in a data center
** Note: If one zone fails within the region the next zone takes over. 
   Example: 
     -> Region Code: us-east1 
        Regions: Moncks Corner, South Carolina, North America
        Zones: us-east1-a, us-east1-b, us-east1-c
