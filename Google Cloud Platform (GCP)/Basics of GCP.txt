Why we need Regions and Zones
-> Scenario 1: 
   - Application is deployed in a data center in London Region.
     What would be the challenges?
     * Challenge 1: Slow access for users from other parts of the world known as "High Latency"
     * Challenge 2: What if the data center in London Region crashes?
       - Answer: Application goes down which means this architecture has "low availablity"
 
 Possible solution to Scenerio 1: Set up Multiple Data Centers
 - Add one more data center in London Region
   What would be the challenges?
   * Challenge 1: Still slow access for users from other parts of the world known as "High Latency"
   * Challenge 2: (Solved) What if the data center in London Region crashes?
      - Answer: Appication is still available from other data center
   * New Challenge: What if entire London Region goes down?
      - Answer: Application will go down
   
 Complete soultion to Scenerio 1: Set up Multiple Regions with Multiple Data Centers per region
  - Add new Mumbai Region
   What would be the challenges?
   * Challenge 1: (Solved) Slow access for users from other parts of the world
     ** Note: if there are an influx of users in other parts of the world, say New York, you would like add another Region in New York
   * Challenge 2: (Solved) What if the data center in London Region crashes?
      - Answer: Appication is still available from other data center
   * Challenge 3: (Solved) What if entire London Region goes down?
      - Answer: Application is served from Mumbai
