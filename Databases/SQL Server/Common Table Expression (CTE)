In SQL, a Common Table Expression (CTE) is an essential tool for simplifying complex queries and making them more readable. 
By defining temporary result sets that can be referenced multiple times, a CTE in SQL allows developers to break down complicated logic into manageable parts. 
CTEs help with hierarchical data representation, improve code reusability, and simplify maintenance.
