No
- MongoDB time series collections: Automatically consolidates multiple readings into larger "bucket" documents. Transparent to developers and applications. Minimizes storage footprint and enhances queryability.

** Note: Storingthank you readings individually can be inefficient
         Redundant data, large indexes, inefficient queries
