What is a Vector Database?
- Vector Database is a specialized database designed to store, manage, and query high-dimensional VectorDBs
- Vectors are numerical representations that capture the semantic meaning of data
- Indexes and stores vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search

The Evolution from Traditional to Vector Databases
- Traditional databases store data in structured formats like rows and columns
- Fall short when we need to perform semantic searches, searches based on the meaning of data rather exact words

What is a Vector?
- A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction, represented as a list of numbers: [1.2,3.4,-0.8]
- Vectors are used to represent complex data in a way that AI models can process, numerical summaries of information
- Vectors exist in high-dimensional space, which is harder to visualize but incredibly powerful for computations
    * Ex. Instead of saying "it's round, orange, and sweet"
          We can encode these features numerically in a vector: [roundness:0.9, color: 0.8, sweetness: 0.7]

What are Vector Embeddings?
- Dense numerical representations of data, capture the semantic meaning of text, images, audio or other data types.
  Step 1) Input Data: Start with raw data, like a sentence, an image, or a sound file
  Step 2) Use an AI Embedding Model: Pass the data through an AI model, like a Transformer model
  Step 3) Transforms the input into a vector embedding, list of numbers

Why are Embeddings Important?
- Compare and analyze data based on semantic meaning rather than surface-level features
- If two sentences have similar meanings, their embeddings will be close in high-dimensional space
